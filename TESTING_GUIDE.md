# üß™ Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. **Start the Development Server**
```bash
npx expo start
```

### 2. **Test Authentication Flow**

#### **Login Testing:**
- **Demo Credentials**: `user@example.com` / `password`
- **Invalid Credentials**: Try wrong email/password to test error handling
- **Validation**: Try empty fields, invalid email format, short passwords

#### **Signup Testing:**
- Fill all required fields (Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password)
- Test password mismatch validation
- Test email format validation
- Test minimum password length (6 characters)

#### **Forgot Password Testing:**
- Enter email address
- Verify alert shows success message
- Test with empty email field

### 3. **Navigation Testing**

#### **After Login:**
- Should navigate to main app dashboard
- Test drawer navigation (hamburger menu)
- Test tab navigation at bottom
- Test back navigation

#### **Skip Authentication:**
- Click "Skip" button on any auth screen
- Should go directly to main app

### 4. **Main App Features**

#### **Dashboard:**
- View welcome card and stats
- Test quick action buttons
- Test document upload functionality

#### **Drawer Navigation:**
- Books library
- AI Chat
- Study rooms
- Leaderboard
- Solana features
- Settings

#### **Tab Navigation:**
- Library (document management)
- Chat (AI conversations)
- Collab (study rooms)
- Achievements
- Settings

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ **What Should Work:**
- Smooth navigation between screens
- Proper authentication state management
- Form validation with clear error messages
- Loading states during authentication
- Responsive design on different screen sizes
- Consistent styling across all screens

### ‚ùå **Known Limitations:**
- Demo authentication (not connected to real backend)
- Some Solana features require wallet connection
- TypeScript warnings (non-blocking, app still works)

## Troubleshooting

### **If App Won't Start:**
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

### **If Authentication Doesn't Work:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify you're using correct demo credentials
- Try clearing app data/cache

### **If Navigation Is Broken:**
- Check if all screens are properly defined in layouts
- Verify expo-router is properly configured
